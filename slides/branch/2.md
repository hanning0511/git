<h2>Detached HEAD</h2>

Normally, itâ€™s advisable to check out only the tip of a branch by naming the branch directly. Thus, by default, git checkout changes to the tip of a desired branch.

However, you can check out any commit. In such an instance, Git creates a sort of anonymous branch for you called a detached HEAD.
