# Birth of Git (1)

<v-clicks>

- Before the birth of Git, the Linux kernel was developed using the commercial BitKeeper[1] VCS.
- The company that owned BitKeeper placed additional restrictions on its “free as in beer” version in the spring of 2005, the Linux community realized that BitKeeper was no longer a viable solution.
- Torvalds looked for alternatives. Failed. He set out to write his own, the Git.
- Key events of Git:
  - Development began on **3 April 2005**.
  - Torvalds announced the project on **6 April 2005**.
  - Git became self-hosted on **7 April 2005**.
