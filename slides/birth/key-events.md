  commit 1da177e4c3f41524e886b7f1b8a0c1fc7321cac2
  Author: Linus Torvalds <torvalds@ppc970.osdl.org>

  Linux-2.6.12-rc2

  Initial git repository build. I'm not bothering with the full history,
  even though we have it. We can create a separate "historical" git
  archive of that later if we want to, and in the meantime it's about
  3.2GB when imported into git - space that would just make the early
  git days unnecessarily complicated, when we don't have a lot of good
  infrastructure for it.

  Let it rip!
