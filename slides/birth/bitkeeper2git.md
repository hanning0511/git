<!-- 
- Before the birth of Git, the Linux kernel was developed using the commercial BitKeeper[1] VCS.
- The company that owned BitKeeper placed additional restrictions on its “free as in beer” version in the spring of 2005, the Linux community realized that BitKeeper was no longer a viable solution.
- Torvalds looked for alternatives. Failed. He set out to write his own, the Git.
